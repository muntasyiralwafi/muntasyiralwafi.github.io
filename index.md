## <a name="me"></a>ABOUT ME

I am a PhD Student in **Building Science** at **Toronto Metropolitan University**, supervised by [**Dr. Jenn McArthur**](https://www.torontomu.ca/architectural-science/people/faculty/jennifer-mcarthur/). My research focuses on **retrofit feasibility** studying how to make large-scale building retrofits faster, cheaper, and lower in carbon. I develop models to estimate the **cost, time, and life-cycle carbon** of retrofit projects.  

My work combines **Building Information Modeling (BIM)**, **Life Cycle Assessment**, and **Machine Learning** to help building owners and cities plan efficient retrofit strategies. As part of [**DECODER project**](https://www.concordia.ca/research/volt-age/initiatives/impact-programs/digitalization-for-energy-efficiency-through-commissioning-and-decarbonization-retrofits.html), I build tools to compare retrofit options across many buildings and identify the most effective solutions for reducing emissions. My Aim to support data-driven retrofit planning that helps cities cut emissions, extend building life, and improve energy performance at scale.

Before joining TMU, I completed an **MSc in Architecture** at *Bahcesehir University*, where my thesis *“From Crisis to Resilience: Affordable Housing in Toronto”* examined the link between housing resilience and affordability. I also hold a **BSc in Urban and Regional Planning** from *Yildiz Technical University*. My previous work includes research and project experience with **UN-Habitat**, **Impact Circles**, and **Urban Minds**
